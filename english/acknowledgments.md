# Acknowledgments {-}

I’d like to thank Edward Kmett and Gershom Bazerman for checking my math
and logic. I'm grateful to many volunteers who corrected my mistakes and improved the book.

I’d like to thank Andrew Sutton for rewriting my C++ monoid concept
code according to his and Bjarne Stroustrup’s latest proposal.

I'm grateful to Eric Niebler for reading the draft and providing the
clever implementation of `compose` that uses advanced features of
C++14 to drive type inference. I was able to cut the whole section of
old fashioned template magic that did the same thing using type traits.
Good riddance!
I’m also grateful to Gershom Bazerman for useful comments that helped me clarify some important points.
