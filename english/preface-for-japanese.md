# Preface to the Japanese edition {-}

In 2014 I was looking for a new writing project.
A few years earlier I had written a book about C++.
Later I learned Haskell, which made me think of writing about functional programming in C++.
But that would be too easy.
Instead I decided to challenge myself and take a deep dive into category theory.
I read Saunders Mac Lane's ``Categories for the Working Mathematician'' and started reformulating its ideas using language more familiar to programmers.

Programming languages change, books about them become outdated, and new technologies replace old ones, but mathematics is here to stay.
Even though some mathematicians jokingly refer to category theory as ``abstract nonsense,'' it has turned out to be a real success story in programming.

Japan played a pivotal role in the development of category theory.
``Proof by Yoneda lemma'' is almost a cliché in the field.
This theorem by the great Japanese mathematician Nobuo Yoneda is truly a cornerstone of category theory.
That's why I'm very happy to see my book available in Japanese.
